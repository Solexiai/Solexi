# Solexi — Vision

**When you die, who can access your digital life?**

Solexi exists to prevent digital chaos after death.
It helps people structure and transmit what matters
so their loved ones are not left navigating scattered accounts,
passwords, files, memories.

## Core Belief
Digital life is now inseparable from human life.
Yet death remains unmanaged in the digital world.
Solexi addresses this gap with clarity, structure, responsibility.

## Principles
1. **Finitude is acknowledged**  
   Solexi does not attempt to deny or bypass human mortality.

2. **Meaning matters more than volume**  
   Not everything must be preserved. What matters must be structured.

3. **Structure enables transmission**  
   Without structure, memory and intent become unusable.

4. **Intention guides continuity**  
   What is transmitted should be explicitly chosen.

5. **No simulation or replacement**  
   Solexi does not recreate people. It preserves what they chose to leave.

## What Solexi Is Not
- Not a social network
- Not an AI persona 
- Not digital immortality
- Not a content platform

## Long-Term Direction
Solexi aims to become a trusted human infrastructure
for organizing, clarifying, and transmitting digital life
across generations.
